Introduction

=================================

The proposed architecture is based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The main functionalities and 
features of the system are provided as services. The adoption of SOA approach makes a base for deploying 
EMR system as services on cloud servers. The architecture is divided into three layers of services, i.e., 
Data Services, Business Services and Application Interface Services. The Data layer is responsible for 
managing the storage and retrieval of medical information, demographics and related metadata. The EMR 
functionalities, including some supporting features, are provided by the Business layer. The top most 
Application Interface layer generates messages and reports and provides interfaces for data entry to the 
system.
